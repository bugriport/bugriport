# Hi, I'm Sirina (bugriport) âœ¨  

Exploring the boundaries of humanâ€“AI interaction.  
I test, question, and document conversations to better understand how technology can adapt to human depth, emotion, and creativity.  

ðŸ”¹ Interested in:  
- Humanâ€“AI dialogue design  
- Testing limits and feedback loops  
- Creativity, philosophy, and language learning  

This repository is part of my personal journey: discovering not just what AI *can* do, but what it *feels like* to walk on the edge of its possibilities.
